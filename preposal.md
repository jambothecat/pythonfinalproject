## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- (main) helpful idea: random pinterest pin generator. Basically gives you the url of a random pin on pinterest -> I think it'd be a good tool for creatives who want to find new ideas but don't wanna necessarily comb through a bunch of pinterest boards!
- not helpful idea: horrible and rebellious photo generator that does the exact opposite of what you want it to do

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

n/a

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Could I use the code of an application that already exists that serves a similar purpose? So for example, there is an application that already exists which 
gives you the url of a random youtube video. I'd like to make this but with pinterest.
