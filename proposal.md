# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pinterest Pin Generator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Randomly generatorated pin from a Pinterest search result.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using python, the feature will have a place to input the desired word. After an input is given, it will return a randomly generated link from the search results. It will use a web scraper. It'll be executed through Python.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

...

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

It gives a random link given a word from the user.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Same as the good outcome, but it gives the image itself rather than the link.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A completely random pin with no input.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some skills we'd have to learn for this project would be to learn how to web scrape, how Pinterest's webpages work, and how Pinterest links work. We'd also look at other people's code to see what they did. Both of us would do general research on each skill. Once we gsther our resources, we will just split it from there and ping-pong the workload back and forth.
