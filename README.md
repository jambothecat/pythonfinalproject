Python project! If there's anything we can improve, let us know!

# PART ONE: What is This?
The purpose of this program is to fetch a random pin from the search results of one or more search queries.



# PART TWO: Prerequisites and Things to Keep in Mind

**YOU WILL NEED:**
* Python
* BeautifulSoup
* Google Chrome

**How to Download BeautifulSoup (once Python has been installed):

!! DOUBLE CHECK IF PIP IS PROPERLY INSTALLED FIRST !!

WINDOWS: "pip install beautifulsoup4" / "python3 -m pip install beautifulsoup4"
MAC OS: "pip3 install beautifulsoup4"
LINUX: "pip install beautifulsoup4"

***Any error with any semblance of "node connection" should be ignored, as it's an error with the webdriver, not the code. If there's
an output with a Pinterest link directly below it, you're good.
***If there is no link output, then Pinterest changed their HTML. Please send a pull request if this is the case.





# PART THREE: The Good Stuff

1) Edit "searchQueries.csv" in your program of choice to your desired search query. ONE ROW = ONE SEARCH QUERY
2) Open up the command terminal.

WINDOWS / LINUX:
3) Type "cd [DIRECTORY YOU DOWNLOADED THE CODE IN]".
4) Type "cd pinterestpingenerator".
5) Type "randompin.py".

MAC:
3) Type "python [PATH TO THE DIRECTORY YOU DOWNLOADED THE CODE IN]".
4) Type "python randompin.py".

6) Copy and paste the link output into your browser of choice.
    6a) IF YOU PUT IN MULTIPLE SEARCH QUERIES, the program will just run twice. 





# PART FOUR: Credits

Majority of the code is from The Hippie Hacker's Pinterest recipe scraper. Thank you!
